# changelog

"changelog" is a simple CLI based changelog generator. 
It's a port from JS ([connvetional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog)) to Go.

It uses git metadata, based on [these commit conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/).

View [conventional-changelog/CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/CONVENTIONS.md) for a synposis of the conventions with commit examples.
